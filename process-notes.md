Getting Started

1) in terminal in folder you want to create app in, type 'npx create-next-app', follow prompts (not sure if you should allow typescript or eslint in project or not or if it's easy to retroactively add (I think you might just have to npm install it))
2) cd into that folder in terminal and type 'code .'
3) copy instructor's dependencis from his github (this is from april 2022, so not everything will be current -> eventually can update) and put into my package.json. In terminal, type 'npm install --legacy-peer-deps'.
4) set up a new repository on github (*no readme) and link this up to it using instructions in my github notes on computer
5) Now that you're linked up to github, in terminal, type 'npm run dev', command click 'localhost:3000' in terminal to open up in browser - make sure to comment out the stuff i have in this git commit ('got server running, had to comment out some stuff in index.js to get …
…it running bc not all dependencies from npx create next app we're going to use in this version and it was referencing them') in pages/index.js. This has to do with dependency issues in next.js v13 are we're in v12. Also, will need to restart server to get it to work **Note might have to put the below code in Head of Layout component later to be able to change the favicon. Also, not sure what the meta stuff does or if it's necessary:
        <meta name="description" content="Generated by create next app" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
6) set up sanity.io - click on link in his youtube description for where we're getting this info, but in terminal, stop server, then type 'npm install -g @sanity/cli'. Next, in terminal, type 'npm create sanity@latest -- --coupon javascriptmastery2022'. Follow prompts (i logged in using email, and **Make sure to use 'clean' project for template type and yes for public dataset configuration). Now, it seems like you have to cd into new sanity folder from folder you're currently in, but first I WOULD SUGGEST RENAMING FOLER TO 'SANITY_SOMETHING' bc that is our sanity studio. In terminal, you can now use commands like: 
npm run dev - to run Sanity Studio

Other helpful commands
sanity docs - to open the documentation in a browser
sanity manage - to open the project settings in a browser
sanity help - to explore the CLI manual

7) create our first schema, the product schema. I believe this the object for the data we will be storing in sanity.io and will allow us to be able to change data within sanity
8) create the rest of your schemas (did this in last commit)
9) create schema.js file (still in schemas folder) that links us up to our sanity desk (npm run dev while cd'd in sanity folder in terminal). COULDN'T get it working though, seems like everything is linked to index.js, so formatted it to work in index.js instead of schema.js. I think it works but may have messed up - look into if this is currently how you structure this. So not sure if schema.js does anything -> **NOTE - it looks like all you have to do if want to make edits to sanity desk is update the schema file of the desired thing you wanna update (e.g. add discount property or whatever to product.js in schema folder). Then you just stop server when cd'd in sanity folder and run npm run dev again. Not sure if this works exactly like this when already deployed though. Might have to undeploy or just push changes to github.
10) Now follow git commits instructions

Incorporating Tailwind

1) in terminal, had to type 'npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer --legacy-peer-deps'
2) in terminal, type 'npx tailwindcss init -p'


What Files We'll Need for Sanity
- products (make sure to add category and featured boolean (for featured items) property)
- categories (make sure to add featured boolean property too)
- blogs


Sanity.io Notes
- to make changes to a schema(aka an object in sanity studio) -> it looks like all you have to do if want to make edits to sanity desk is update the schema file of the desired thing you wanna update (e.g. add discount property or whatever to product.js in schema folder). Then you just stop server when cd'd in sanity folder and run npm run dev again. Not sure if this works exactly like this when already deployed though. Might have to undeploy or just push changes to github.
- I believe the client.js file in the lib folder is what is connecting us to
