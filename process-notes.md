Getting Started

1) in terminal in folder you want to create app in, type 'npx create-next-app', follow prompts (not sure if you should allow typescript or eslint in project or not or if it's easy to retroactively add (I think you might just have to npm install it))
2) cd into that folder in terminal and type 'code .'
3) copy instructor's dependencis from his github (this is from april 2022, so not everything will be current -> eventually can update) and put into my package.json. In terminal, type 'npm install --legacy-peer-deps'.
4) set up a new repository on github (*no readme) and link this up to it using instructions in my github notes on computer
5) Now that you're linked up to github, in terminal, type 'npm run dev', command click 'localhost:3000' in terminal to open up in browser - make sure to comment out the stuff i have in this git commit ('got server running, had to comment out some stuff in index.js to get …
…it running bc not all dependencies from npx create next app we're going to use in this version and it was referencing them') in pages/index.js. Note might have to put the below code in Head of Layout component later to be able to change the favicon. Also, not sure what the meta stuff does or if it's necessary:
        <meta name="description" content="Generated by create next app" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
