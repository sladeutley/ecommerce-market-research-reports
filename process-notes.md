Getting Started

1) in terminal in folder you want to create app in, type 'npx create-next-app', follow prompts (not sure if you should allow typescript or eslint in project or not or if it's easy to retroactively add (I think you might just have to npm install it))
2) cd into that folder in terminal and type 'code .'
3) copy instructor's dependencis from his github (this is from april 2022, so not everything will be current -> eventually can update) and put into my package.json. In terminal, type 'npm install --legacy-peer-deps'.
4) set up a new repository on github (*no readme) and link this up to it using instructions in my github notes on computer
